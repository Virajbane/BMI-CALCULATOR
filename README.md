BMI Calculator and Leap Year Checker with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
This repository contains the code for two interactive web applications: a Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator and a Leap Year checker. Both applications are built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Features:

BMI Calculator:

Calculates BMI based on user input for height and weight.
Displays the calculated BMI value and categorizes it according to the World Health Organization (WHO) standards (underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese).
Provides a user-friendly interface for easy interaction.
Leap Year Checker:

Determines if a given year is a leap year.
Takes user input for a year and checks its divisibility rules.
Displays a clear message indicating whether the year is a leap year or not.
Technologies Used:

HTML: Provides the basic structure and content of the web pages.
CSS: Styles the layout and appearance of the web pages.
JavaScript: Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to the web pages.
Getting Started:

Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repository-name>.git.
Open the index.html file in your web browser.
Running the Applications:

The BMI Calculator and Leap Year Checker are both located on the same index.html page.
The BMI Calculator section allows users to input their height and weight in designated fields. Clicking the "Calculate BMI" button triggers the JavaScript code to perform the calculation and display the result.
The Leap Year Checker section has a field for users to enter a year. Clicking the "Check Leap Year" button activates the JavaScript code to determine if it's a leap year and display the result.
Project Structure:

index.html: Contains the main HTML structure for both applications.
style.css: Holds the styles applied to the entire web page.
script.js: Includes the JavaScript code for both calculator functionalities.
Further Development:

This project provides a basic foundation for both applications.
You can expand on them by:
Adding a more visually appealing design using CSS frameworks.
Implementing error handling for invalid user inputs.
Enhancing the information displayed alongside the BMI result (e.g., potential health risks).
Adding additional functionalities to the Leap Year Checker (e.g., displaying historical leap years within a specific date range).
I encourage you to explore the code, understand its logic, and customize it to your needs. Feel free to contribute further improvements by creating pull requests!
